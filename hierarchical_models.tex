\section{Motivation}

\subsection{Accounting for Correlation}
The primary motivation for utilizing multilevel and hierarchical structures in regression modeling is to account for correlation structures that are ignored in the standard linear model and generalized 
linear model (GLM) framework. Indeed, consider the standard linear model setup 
\[y_i|x_i \overset{ind}{\sim} N(x_i^T \beta, \sigma^2)\]
In words, we're assuming that once we fix a value of $x_i$ then we can treat all of the observations at that fixed value as essentially identical; that is, their response values $y_i$ are independent 
and vary based on the same Gaussian noise structure. For example, if $x_i$ is just an indicator for age then we treat the outcomes of everybody of the same age as independent. This might be inadequate. 
For example, what if gender has a large effect on $y$, such that the response values tend to cluster together based on gender. In this case, the values $y_i|x_i$ are certainly not independent, so the assumptions
of the model have been violated. Obviously, the solution here would be to add a second predictor corresponding to gender. However, there are often other sources of variation still not accounted for. It can be very 
difficult to account for all of these sources of variation, so trying to do so simply by adding more predictors to the linear model is oftentimes infeasible. One method to account for these issues is to explicitly model the 
correlation structure of the data. However, it is often very difficult to develop a good parametric model for the correlation. Hierarchical models are one approach to accounting for these
complicated correlation structures without having to assume a parametric form for the correlation. 

\subsection{Example}
As a motivating example, I consider the analysis of child support enforcement discussed in Gelman and Hill (2009, ch. 11). The outcome of interest here is a binary indicator of whether a father provided child
support payments (as self-reported by the mother). The sampled families live in a variety of cities, and the main treatment of interest here is a measure of the level of enforcement conducted by the city. I will 
consider the following additional covariates (the model in Gelman and Hill, 2009 includes additional ones as well): the age of the father (individual-level) and a measure of the benefits provided by the city to 
the mother (city-level). As I have made very explicit here, this problem has a very natural hierarchical structure; some variables pertain to individuals while others to cities. To begin, let's consider a basic logit 
model:
\[y_i|x_i \overset{ind}{\sim} \text{Bern}(\text{logit}^{-1}(x_i^T \beta)) \]
where $x_i$ includes the covariates described above as well as city-level indicators. Why might this independence assumption be an issue? Well, the model assumes that the probability of a father providing 
child support is independent within a fixed city and given father age, a fixed city benefit level, and a fixed city enforcement level. However, there are almost certainly other city-level variation that this model 
does not account for. Trying to find more data and account for all these potential sources of variation seems infeasible.
