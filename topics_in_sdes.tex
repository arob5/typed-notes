\section{Time-Homogenous Diffusions}
We are considering the SDE 
\begin{align}
 d\state = \mu(\state) dt + \sigma(\state) d\BM, \label{time_hom_SDE}
\end{align}
where $\mu(\state)$ and $\sigma(\state)$ are assumed time-independent for now. Under this assumption, the solution $\state$ to the SDE has a transition 
kernel which only depends on the time increment; i.e. it is \textbf{time-homogenous}. By \textbf{diffusion}, we mean a solution to an SDE 
(i.e. \ref{time_hom_SDE}), or more generally a continuous-time Markov process with continuous sample paths. 

In particular, we often want to understand the evolution of $f(\state)$, some function of the SDE solution. The question is: how can we study the properties 
of the random process $f(\state)$? A common approach is to instead consider a \textit{non-random} quantity associated with $f(\state)$, which reduces the 
problem to a (presumably easier) deterministic one. Some examples of non-random quantities might be the expectation, probability density, or transition 
density of $f(\state)$. As a starting point, let us consider analyzing the behavior of expectations such as $\E[f(\state) | \state[0] = \stateValue[0]]$. 
Given that we want to understand the evolution of this quantity, a natural thing to do is to consider its time derivative. Appealing to the definition of the 
derivative, we have 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt} \E[f(\state) | \state[0] = \stateValue[0]] 
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\E[f(\state[t+h]) | \state[0] = \stateValue[0]] - \E[f(\state[t]) | \state[0] = \stateValue[0]]}{h} \\
&=  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\E[f(\state[h]) | \state[0] = \stateValue[0]] - \E[f(\state[0]) | \state[0] = \stateValue[0]]}{h} \\
&=  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\E[f(\state[h]) | \state[0] = \stateValue[0]] - \E[f(\state[0]) | \state[0] = \stateValue[0]]}{h} \\
&=  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\E[f(\state[h]) | \state[0] = \stateValue[0]] - f(\stateValue[0])}{h}
\end{align*}
In the second step we have used the time-homogeneity property, which allowed us to just consider $t = 0$. The expression on the right is very important, 
and therefore we introduce a few definitions. First, define the operator $\op$ defined by 
\[
(\op f)(\stateValue[]) := \E[f(\state) | \state[0] = \stateValue[]].
\]

As a specific example, if we take $f(u) = \mathbbm{1}_B(u)$ for some Borel set $B$, then this becomes 
\[
(\op f)(\stateValue[]) = \E[\mathbbm{1}_B(\state) | \state[0] = \stateValue[]] = \Prob(\state \in B | \state[0] = \stateValue[]).
\]

Similarly, choosing $f(u) = \mathbbm{1}(u \leq y)$ yields the transition distribution function for a time-homogenous process:
\[
(\op f)(\stateValue[]) = \E[\mathbbm{1}(\state \leq y) | \state[0] = \stateValue[]] = \Prob(\state \leq y | \state[0] = \stateValue[]).
\]

Let's now plug this new definition for $\op$ back into the derivative expression we had before. Doing so, and letting $\opId$ denote the identity operator, yields 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt} (\op f)(\stateValue[0]) 
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(\op[h] f)(\stateValue[0]) - f(\stateValue[0])}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(\op[h] f)(\stateValue[0]) - (\opId f)(\stateValue[0])}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(\op[h] - \opId)[f](\stateValue[0])}{h} \\
&= \left(\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\op[h] - \opId}{h}\right)[f](\stateValue[0])
\end{align*}

We can thus view the expression in parentheses as another operator that acts on $f$ in order to give the instantaneous time-evolution of the quantity 
$\E[f(\state) | \state[0] = \stateValue[0]]$. This new operator, called the \textbf{infinitesimal generator} is very important, and is the subject of the next section. 

\subsection{The Generator}
The \textbf{infinitesimal generator}, or just \textbf{generator}, of a time-homogenous Markov process is defined as the operator
\begin{align}
\gen = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\op[h] - \opId}{h},
\end{align}
which is just the expression we stumbled across in the previous section. In fact, what we showed in that section is 
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} (\op f)(\stateValue[0]) = \frac{d}{dt} \E[f(\state) | \state[0] = \stateValue[0]] = (\gen f)(\stateValue[0]). \label{generator_time_deriv}
\end{align}
Currently, this quantity is quite-abstract; however, we will shortly derive the specific form it takes for the time-homogenous SDE \ref{time_hom_SDE}. Before that, 
we give a bit more motivation about why the generator will be such a key object to study. 

Let's again consider the case where we choose $f(u) = \mathbbm{1}(u \leq y)$ so that $(\op f)(\stateValue[]) = \Prob(\state \leq y | \state[0] = \stateValue[])$ is the 
transition distribution function. Under certain conditions, the transition density $p(t, \stateValue[], y)$ -- the derivative of this distribution function -- will also exist. 
Notice that this form of the transition density relies on the time-homogeneity assumption; it gives the density of transitioning from state $x$ to state $y$ in a time 
interval of length $t$, independent of the actual starting time. In this case, the expression \ref{generator_time_deriv} becomes 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt} \Prob(\state \leq y | \state[0] = \stateValue[0]) = p(t, \stateValue[0], y) = (\gen f)(\stateValue[0]), 
\end{align*}
so we see that the generator is intimately tied to the transition distribution of the diffusion process. 
This will lead to some powerful results. Peaking ahead, we might 
reasonably call the process \textbf{stationary} if its transition distribution is not changing; i.e. 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt} \Prob(\state \leq y | \state[0] = \stateValue[]) = (\gen f)(\stateValue[]) = 0,
\end{align*} 
which means that $\Prob(\state \leq y | \state[0] = \stateValue[]) = $ is not a function of $t$. We notice that this reasonable definition can be 
re-stated in terms of the null space of the generator. We have been considering functions of the form $f_y(u) = \mathbbm{1}(u \leq y)$. The above 
equality states that in order for the process to be stationary, such functions must be in the null space of $\gen$.
